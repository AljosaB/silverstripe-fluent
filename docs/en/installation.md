# Installation

 * Fluent can be easily installed on any already-developed website, but must be installed
with composer.

```bash
composer require tractorcow/silverstripe-fluent ^4
```

 * Run a `dev/build` to ensure all additional table fields have been generated
 * Configure your locales in the `/admin/locales` section
